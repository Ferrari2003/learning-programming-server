This comprehensive machine learning tutorial includes over 100 lectures spanning 15 hours of video, and most topics include hands-on Python code examples you can use for reference and for practice. Iâ€™ll draw on my 9 years of experience at Amazon and IMDb to guide you through what matters, and what doesnâ€™t. Each concept is introduced in plain English, avoiding confusing mathematical notation and jargon. Itâ€™s then demonstrated using Python code you can experiment with and build upon, along with notes you can keep for future reference. You won't find academic, deeply mathematical coverage of these algorithms in this course - the focus is on practical understanding and application of them. At the end, you'll be given a final project to apply what you've learned! There's also an entire section on machine learning with Apache Spark, which lets you scale up these techniques to big data analyzed on a computing cluster. If you're new to Python, don't worry - the course starts with a crash course. If you've done some programming before, you should pick it up quickly. This course shows you how to get set up on Microsoft Windows-based PC's, Linux desktops, and Macs.If youâ€™re a programmer looking to switch into an exciting new career track, or a data analyst looking to make the transition into the tech industry â€“ this course will teach you the basic techniques used by real-world industry data scientists.
